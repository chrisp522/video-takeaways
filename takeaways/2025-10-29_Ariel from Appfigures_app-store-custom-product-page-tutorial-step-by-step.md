## Key Takeaways
- Custom Product Pages (CPPs) can deliver double-digit conversion improvements by showing users exactly what they want based on their search intent
- 83% of top apps are already using CPPs - you can analyze competitor strategies to learn what works in your category
- CPPs work by targeting specific user segments (e.g., basketball ticket buyers vs general sports fans) rather than just changing colors or doing basic A/B tests
- You can create up to 35 custom product pages per app, allowing you to target very specific niches that are easier to compete in
- For paid campaigns, higher conversion from CPPs directly reduces cost of acquisition since you pay for every impression
- Two main strategies for keyword targeting: use CPPs for long-tail keywords while keeping main keywords on default page, or experiment with Apple Ads first then move successful combinations to organic
- Apple only shows keywords from your keyword list in CPP setup, not from app name/subtitle, which limits targeting options

## Notable Quotes
> "In a world where you pay for every single impression, higher conversion means lower cost of acquisition. So, you can drastically increase the number of downloads you're getting from the same amount of money spent."

> "If someone is looking for basketball tickets. We want to have a set of screenshots that shows why the app is perfect for basketball tickets... if I'm looking for Knicks tickets, I will see screenshots that only have tickets about Nick's games. And to me that means that this is exactly what I want."

> "The poor man's way of taking advantage of custom product pages before actually spending the time... is to shuffle the screenshots. So the use case that is attached to the keyword is the first screenshot or the second screenshot."
