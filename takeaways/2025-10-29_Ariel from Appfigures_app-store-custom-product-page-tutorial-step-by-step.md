## Key Takeaways
- Custom product pages (CPPs) deliver double-digit improvement in conversion rates, reducing cost of acquisition for paid campaigns
- 83% of top apps are using custom product pages, making it essential for competition
- You can create up to 35 custom product pages per app to target different user segments and use cases
- CPPs work by showing specific screenshots matched to search intent (e.g., basketball tickets → Knicks-specific screenshots)
- Focus on showcasing different features/use cases rather than just changing colors - cater screenshots to the specific search query
- Start with a "poor man's approach" by shuffling existing screenshots to highlight relevant features first
- Target longtail keywords with CPPs while keeping main keywords on your default product page
- Use Apple Ads to quickly test which keyword + CPP combinations work best, then move successful ones to organic

## Notable Quotes
> "In a world where you pay for every single impression, higher conversion means lower cost of acquisition. So, you can drastically increase the number of downloads you're getting from the same amount of money spent."

> "If someone is looking for basketball tickets. We want to have a set of screenshots that shows why the app is perfect for basketball tickets... if I'm looking for Knicks tickets, I will see screenshots that only have tickets about Nick's games. And to me that means that this is exactly what I want."

> "My way of learning, as with pretty much everything, is learning from the competition... you can see what they're targeting, how they group their users, and what they're trying to go after."

## Action Items
- [ ] Analyze 2-3 top competitors in your category to see their custom product page strategies and targeted keywords
