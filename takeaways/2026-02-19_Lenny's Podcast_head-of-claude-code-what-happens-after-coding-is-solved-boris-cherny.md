## Key Takeaways
- Boris hasn't written a single line of code by hand since November 2024 - 100% of his code is now written by Claude Code, shipping 10-30 pull requests daily
- Productivity per engineer at Anthropic has increased 200% while 4x-ing the engineering team size
- Some engineers at Anthropic are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly on tokens, with token costs potentially exceeding salaries for high-usage engineers
- Claude Code was built in a terminal initially due to resource constraints, but this "underresourcing" forced innovation and kept pace with rapidly improving models
- Co-work (Claude's general task agent) was built in just 10 days using Claude Code to write all the code
- The principle of "latent demand" - observing how users misuse your product reveals what to build next (40% of Facebook group posts were buying/selling, leading to Marketplace)
- Claude Code's growth is still accelerating - daily active users doubled in just the past month

## Notable Quotes
> "I have never enjoyed coding as much as I do today because I don't have to deal with all the minutia."

> "I think by the end of the year, everyone's going to be a product manager and everyone codes. The title software engineer is going to start to go away. It's just going to be replaced by builder."

> "In a year or two, it's not going to matter. Coding is largely solved."

## Action Items
- [ ] Give your engineering team unlimited or very high token budgets to experiment freely with AI tools
- [ ] Build AI products for where models will be in 6 months, not where they are today
- [ ] Look for "latent demand" - observe how users are misusing your current products to discover what to build next
- [ ] Don't try to box AI models into rigid workflows - give them tools and goals, let them figure out the approach
- [ ] Become a generalist across multiple disciplines rather than specializing in just one area
