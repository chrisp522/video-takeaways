## Key Takeaways
- **Extreme experimentation culture**: Daily testing and iteration was crucial for survival - launching tests every day and reviewing results the next day
- **Product-channel fit discovery**: Snapchat became their breakthrough channel with much lower CAC than other platforms because they were early adopters before competition saturated it
- **CAC to LTV was 3:1 negative initially**: Took 6-9 months of bold changes and scaling from California to Texas to achieve positive unit economics
- **Diversification failure**: Adding live streaming features led to critical loss of focus and failed - they removed it and returned to pure dating focus in 2022
- **Push notification sophistication**: 30+ different logic systems based on user behavior patterns, with personalized messaging driving much higher engagement than generic promotional content
- **Onboarding monetization**: Long personalized onboarding with quizzes and $3 "tripwire" boost purchases help convert users immediately and identify high-value customers
- **Network density critical**: Dating apps require sufficient user density in geographic regions to provide value, making acquisition essential for retention
