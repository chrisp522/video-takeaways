## Key Takeaways
- Built 28 apps in 8 months while working full-time, growing from $200/month to $10,000/month
- 80/20 rule applies - 4 top apps generate ~$1,500 each, rest generate smaller amounts
- Uses ASO tool (Astro) to find keywords with 20%+ popularity and 60-70% difficulty
- Validates markets by checking competitor revenue ($100-200/month minimum benchmark)
- Ships apps in 2 hours to 1 week by reusing 90% of code components (UI, onboarding, paywall)
- Uses AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) for implementation plans and app descriptions
- Total monthly costs under $300 (Cursor $20, OpenAI $200, others minimal)
- Focuses on single core feature per app, ships lean MVP, then moves to next project

## Notable Quotes
> "Once the app is live, just let it go and move on to the next project."

> "I have a record. One app I've built in 2 hours."

> "Don't waste your time on polishing it up, thinking about adding one more killer feature... Get it ready bugs free, just one single feature, ship it, and let users tell you what they think about it while you're building another app."

## Action Items
- [ ] Research app keywords using ASO tools like Astro, targeting 20%+ popularity and 60-70% difficulty
- [ ] Validate market potential by checking top competitor revenues using Sensor Tower
- [ ] Build reusable UI components (settings, onboarding, paywall) to accelerate future app development
- [ ] Use AI tools to generate implementation plans and app descriptions before coding
- [ ] Ship MVP with single core feature, monitor for 2-3 months, then double down on winners with ads and improvements
