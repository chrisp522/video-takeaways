## Key Takeaways
- Photo Revive AI makes $500K/month by niching down on "photo restoration" instead of competing broadly with AI image generators
- The app uses credit-based pricing (240-570 credits/day) to manage AI costs while showing "per day" pricing ($0.13/day sounds cheaper than $47.99/year)
- No free trial approach can work well for certain AI apps - they show paywall immediately after onboarding
- Rewarded actions system gives free credits for social follows, notifications, and sharing without forcing compliance
- Watermarked outputs create viral distribution as users share enhanced photos on social media
- App combines niche positioning with full feature set - offers photo restoration AND text-to-image/video features

## Notable Quotes
> "Rather than catering to the text to image, text to video audience, they decided to niche down with their app name and their screenshots and also still provide the same features."

> "If you have an AI app and you're worried about AI cost, this is one way of doing it. They've done pretty well with this."

> "If you got a meditation app, start with deep breathing. Start more niche so that you can start get that early traction, early revenues, early ASO traction and then start expanding."

## Action Items
- [ ] Research niche positioning for your AI app instead of competing broadly (e.g., "deep breathing" vs "meditation")
